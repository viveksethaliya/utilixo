## Why PC Performance Degrades Over Time

- Too many background applications
- Unnecessary startup programs
- Visual effects consuming system resources
- Old or slow storage (HDD)
- Accumulated unused software

## Solution 1: Enable High Performance Power Plan

Windows often limits performance to save power.

**Step 1:** Press **Windows + R**, type `powercfg.cpl`, press **Enter**

**Step 2:** Select **High performance**

**Step 3:** If not visible, click **Show additional plans**

> This allows CPU and hardware to run at full capability.


## Solution 2: Turn Off Visual Animations

Animations look nice but reduce responsiveness on low-to-mid hardware.

**Step 1:** Press **Windows + R**, type `sysdm.cpl`

**Step 2:** Go to **Advanced** tab → **Performance** → **Settings**

**Step 3:** Select **Adjust for best performance**

**Step 4:** Click **Apply** → **OK**

> You can manually re-enable essential visuals if needed.


## Solution 3: Uninstall Unwanted Software

Unused software runs services in the background and wastes disk space.

**Step 1:** Open **Settings** → **Apps** → **Installed apps**

**Step 2:** Sort by **Installed size** or **Install date**

**Step 3:** Uninstall apps you no longer use

**Step 4:** Restart PC after cleanup

> Avoid removing system or driver-related applications.

## Solution 4: Disable Startup Programs

Too many startup apps slow boot time and background performance.

**Step 1:** Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open **Task Manager**

**Step 2:** Go to **Startup** tab

**Step 3:** Disable apps marked **High impact** (except antivirus)

## Solution 5: Do NOT Install Third-Party Performance Boosters

- Most “PC booster” apps:
  - Add background services
  - Show fake performance issues
  - Push ads or subscriptions
- Windows already has built-in optimization tools

> Third-party optimizers often reduce stability instead of improving speed.

## Solution 6: Upgrade to SSD (Biggest Real Improvement)

If your PC uses an HDD, upgrading to SSD gives massive speed gains.

**Benefits of SSD:**
- 5–10× faster boot times
- Faster app launches
- Better system responsiveness
- Reduced noise and heat

**Recommendation:**
- Minimum: **240 GB SSD**
- Ideal: **500 GB SSD**

> Even old PCs feel new after SSD upgrade.

## Optional Maintenance Tips

- Keep Windows updated
- Clean temporary files using **Storage Sense**
- Ensure proper cooling and airflow
- Update essential drivers only (GPU, chipset)

## Summary (What Actually Works)

- Use **High performance** power plan
- Disable unnecessary **animations**
- Remove **unused software**
- Avoid fake **booster tools**
- Invest in an **SSD upgrade**

These methods are safe, proven, and effective without risking system stability.
