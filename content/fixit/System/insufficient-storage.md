## What Is Insufficient Storage or Full Disk Problem

**Insufficient storage** occurs when the system drive (usually **C:**) becomes nearly or completely full. This slows down Windows, prevents updates, and may stop applications from saving files properly.

Common symptoms include:
- “Low Disk Space” warnings  
- Windows updates failing  
- Slow system performance  
- Applications crashing or freezing  
- Unable to save files or install software  

---

## Why Storage Fills Up Quickly

- Accumulated temporary files and caches  
- Large downloads and unused installers  
- Old Windows update files  
- Installed software no longer in use  
- Media files stored on system drive  

---

## Solution 1: Use Windows Storage Sense

Windows includes a built-in cleanup tool.

**Step 1:** Open **Settings** → **System** → **Storage**

**Step 2:** Turn on **Storage Sense**

**Step 3:** Click **Configure Storage Sense** → **Run Storage Sense now**

> This safely removes temporary files and unused data.

## Solution 2: Uninstall Unused Applications

Installed programs can consume large amounts of space.

**Step 1:** Open **Settings** → **Apps** → **Installed apps**

**Step 2:** Sort by **Size**

**Step 3:** Uninstall apps you no longer use

---

## Solution 3: Clean Temporary and System Files

**Step 1:** In **Storage**, click **Temporary files**

**Step 2:** Select items such as:
- Temporary files  
- Windows Update Cleanup  
- Recycle Bin  

**Step 3:** Click **Remove files**

> Avoid deleting Downloads unless reviewed carefully.

---

## Solution 4: Move Personal Files to Another Drive

Large personal files should not stay on the system drive.

**Step 1:** Move videos, photos, and documents to another drive  

**Step 2:** Use an external drive or secondary internal disk  

**Step 3:** Change default save locations in **Storage settings**

---

## Solution 5: Clear Large Hidden Folders (Advanced)

Some folders silently grow over time.

- `C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download`
- Browser cache folders
- Application cache directories

> Do not delete system folders unless you understand their purpose.

---

## Solution 6: Expand Storage or Upgrade to Larger Drive

If disk space runs out frequently, hardware upgrade is the best fix.

**Recommended options:**
- Upgrade to a larger **SSD**  
- Add a secondary internal drive  
- Use external storage for media files  

> SSD upgrades dramatically improve both storage and performance.

---

## Prevention Tips

- Maintain at least **20–25% free disk space**  
- Enable Storage Sense permanently  
- Install large software on secondary drives  
- Avoid using system drive for heavy media storage  
- Clean downloads folder regularly  

---

## When Low Storage Becomes Critical

- Windows cannot update  
- System becomes extremely slow  
- Frequent application crashes  

These indicate urgent cleanup or storage expansion is required.

## Summary

Full disk or insufficient storage problems directly impact system performance and stability. Regular cleanup, smart file organization, and timely storage upgrades prevent slowdowns and system failures.
