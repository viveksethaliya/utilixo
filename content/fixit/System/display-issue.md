## What Are Display or Graphics Issues

**Display or graphics issues** occur when the screen shows abnormal visuals such as flickering, distortion, color artifacts, tearing, or corrupted output. These problems can appear intermittently or persistently and may affect usability and performance.

Common symptoms include:
- Screen flickering or blinking
- Colored lines, blocks, or visual artifacts
- Distorted resolution or stretched display
- Black screen flashes or signal drop
- Garbled text or textures in games/apps

---

## Why Display or Graphics Problems Occur

- Outdated, corrupted, or incompatible GPU drivers  
- Faulty display cables (HDMI/DP/VGA) or loose connections  
- Incorrect resolution or refresh rate settings  
- Overheating or failing GPU  
- Monitor issues or panel defects  
- Overclocking instability  

---

## Solution 1: Check Cables and Connections

Physical connection issues are common and easy to fix.

**Step 1:** Power off the PC and monitor  

**Step 2:** Reseat the display cable securely  

**Step 3:** Try a different cable or port  

**Step 4:** Test with another monitor if available

> A damaged cable can cause flickering and artifacts.

---

## Solution 2: Set Correct Resolution and Refresh Rate

Incorrect display settings can cause distortion.

**Step 1:** Right-click desktop → **Display settings**  

**Step 2:** Set **Resolution** to the monitor’s native value  

**Step 3:** Click **Advanced display** → set the recommended **Refresh rate**

---

## Solution 3: Update or Reinstall Graphics Drivers

Driver issues are the most common cause.

**Step 1:** Open **Device Manager** → **Display adapters**  

**Step 2:** Right-click GPU → **Update driver**  

**Step 3:** If issues persist, uninstall the driver and reinstall the latest version from the GPU manufacturer’s official website

> Avoid third-party driver updater tools.

---

## Solution 4: Disable Overclocking and Enhancements

Overclocking can destabilize graphics output.

**Step 1:** Reset GPU settings to default  

**Step 2:** Disable third-party overlays or enhancements  

**Step 3:** Restart the system

---

## Solution 5: Check GPU Temperature and Load

Overheating GPUs can produce artifacts and crashes.

**Step 1:** Monitor GPU temperature during use  

**Step 2:** Ensure fans are spinning properly  

**Step 3:** Clean dust from GPU and case fans  

> Sustained temperatures above safe limits can cause visual corruption.

---

## Solution 6: Test in Safe Mode or with Basic Driver

This helps isolate driver-related issues.

**Step 1:** Boot into **Safe Mode**  

**Step 2:** Check if artifacts or flickering persist  

> If the issue disappears, the problem is likely driver or software related.

---

## Solution 7: Check Monitor Health

Sometimes the display itself is the problem.

**Step 1:** Connect the monitor to another PC or device  

**Step 2:** Look for the same distortion or flickering  

**Step 3:** Reset monitor settings to factory defaults

---

## When Graphics Issues Indicate Hardware Failure

- Artifacts appear even in BIOS or boot screen  
- Visual corruption persists across different systems  
- GPU crashes under minimal load  

These signs often indicate a failing GPU or monitor panel.

---

## Prevention Tips

- Keep GPU drivers up to date  
- Avoid unstable overclocking  
- Ensure proper cooling and airflow  
- Use quality display cables  
- Shut down the system properly  

---

## Summary

Display and graphics issues such as flickering, distortion, or artifacts are usually caused by driver problems, incorrect settings, overheating, or faulty cables. Systematic troubleshooting can resolve most issues, while persistent artifacts often point to hardware failure.
